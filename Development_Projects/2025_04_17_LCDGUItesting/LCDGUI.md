This directory is for testing new builds for a touch screen GUI.

# widgetUIqtpython
This is the latest build for the experimental GUI for a touchscreen. Future development plans revolve around the integration of a touch screen that can support all current menus and data streaming.

QtPython community edition will be used for further development of the .ui and .py files. It is highly recommended that changes are made through Qt Creator, and other supported applications under its brand.
