# GroBot
## Introduction
The GroBot is an educational plant growing robot developed by [Ulnooweg Education Centre](https://ulnoowegeducation.ca/) with support 
from the [Canadian Space Agency](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/). It is intended to be an educational, automated, and open-sourced plant
growing enclosure that would teach students plant ecology and plant growing whilst allowing them to assemble the GroBot using low-cost
and easily sourced parts.

The GroBot has the following capability:
1. Fully automated plant growing with automated light control, irrigation, and temperature/humidity normalization.
2. Easy to use with fully replacable user code with no terminal access required. Automatic data and picture recording for later processing.
