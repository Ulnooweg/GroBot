#Code: watercontrol
#Version: 1.0.4
#Description: This function controls watering
#Function: autorain(mmrain), turns on the pump for a time such that the water delivered is "mmrain" mm of rain
#          stopwater(), turns of the pump upon being called
#Input: autorain(...) requires mmrain as a numerical input, stopwater() requires no input
#Output: NONE
#Error Handling: returns 0 on failure, 1 on success, 2 on low water
#
#POST-SCRIPT: Water level check in autorain is currently turned off pending further investigation to make it more consistent.
